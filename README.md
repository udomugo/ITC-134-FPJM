 Conversion Program: Test Driven Development

The purpose of this repository is to create a program to convert temperature betweens Fahrenheit and Celsius. The input would be taken from a user-interactive web form, sent to the program which would do the conversion and print it back for the user to see.

We want it to be able to fulfill the following steps:
1. Take user input for whether the degrees are in F or C.
2. Take user input on the degree value.
3. Convert to opposite temperature measure.
4. Display the converted degrees.
